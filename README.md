# RProxid[Root version]
## Welcome to RProxid
RProxid is a Proxifier alternative tool on the Android platform.

RProxid allows network applications that do not support working through proxy servers to operate through a SOCKS or HTTP(S) proxy.

With RProxid you can easily tunnel all TCP/UDP connections on the selected application(s) to different proxy servers, it means RProxid can set different proxy for each application and they can work in parallel.

## RProxid allows you to:

* Run any network applications through a proxy server. No special configuration is required for the software; the entire process is completely transparent.

* Set different proxies for selected application(s) at the same time.

* Access the Internet from a restricted network through a proxy server gateway.

* Bypass firewall restrictions.

* Secure privacy by hiding your IP address.

* View information like status, public IPs, traffic, in real-time.
## Typical usage scenario:

You have two ISPs with different data plans, ISP1 and ISP2, and you want to let App1's traffic go through ISP1 and App2's traffic go through ISP2 so they can have different IP addresses and use different data plan, you also want to let some applications use public socks/http(s) proxies directly. Here is a simple topology example:
